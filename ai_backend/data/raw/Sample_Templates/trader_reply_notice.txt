... Complainant

VERSUS

[OPPOSITE_PARTY_NAME]
[OPPOSITE_PARTY_ADDRESS]
... Opposite Party / Respondent

WRITTEN STATEMENT / REPLY
ON BEHALF OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY

RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH:

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

That the present complaint is wholly misconceived, groundless, and unsustainable in law and is liable to be dismissed at the threshold.

That this Hon’ble Commission lacks the jurisdiction to entertain this complaint as the matter is [SPECIFY_REASON, e.g., “a purely civil dispute” / “not a consumer dispute” / “related to a commercial purpose”].

That the Complainant is not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(7) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, as the goods/services were availed for a [COMMERCIAL_PURPOSE / FOR_RESALE].

That the complaint suffers from non-joinder of necessary parties, namely [NAME_OF_PARTY_NOT_JOINED], without whom the dispute cannot be properly adjudicated.

That the complaint is barred by limitation under Section 69 of the Consumer Protection Act, as the alleged cause of action arose on [DATE_OF_CAUSE_OF_ACTION] whereas the complaint was filed on [DATE_OF_FILING].

That this Hon’ble Commission does not have the [PECUNIARY / TERRITORIAL] jurisdiction to adjudicate this complaint because [STATE_REASON, e.g., “the cause of action arose outside its territorial limits” or “the value exceeds its pecuniary jurisdiction”].

That the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, and filed only to harass the Opposite Party, and is liable to be dismissed with exemplary costs under Section 26 of the Act.

REPLY ON MERITS (PARA-WISE)

That Para 1 of the complaint is a matter of record and needs no reply. (Or “Denied for want of knowledge.”)

That Para 2 of the complaint is admitted to the extent of [STATE_ADMITTED_FACT, e.g., “the Complainant purchased the product on [DATE]”]. The remaining allegations are false and denied. It is submitted that [STATE_YOUR_VERSION].

That Para 3 of the complaint, alleging [DEFECT / DEFICIENCY_ALLEGED_BY_COMPLAINANT], is denied. The Opposite Party submits that [COUNTER_FACTS, e.g., “the product was in perfect working condition and inspected before delivery” / “the delay occurred due to factors beyond control”].

That Para 4 of the complaint is wrong and denied. The allegations regarding [SPECIFIC_ALLEGATION] are baseless and contrary to record.

That without prejudice to the above, it is submitted that [MENTION_GOODWILL_ACTION, e.g., “as a gesture of goodwill, service/repair was offered free of cost but the Complainant refused”].

That all other allegations not specifically admitted are denied in toto.

PRAYER

In view of the foregoing, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Commission may kindly be pleased to:
a) Dismiss the present complaint with exemplary costs; and
b) Pass any other or further order as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.
