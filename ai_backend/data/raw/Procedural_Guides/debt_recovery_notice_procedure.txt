PROCEDURE FOR SENDING A LEGAL NOTICE FOR DEBT RECOVERY (INDIAN CONTRACT ACT, 1872)

This process helps recover money legally owed under a loan or contract.

Step 1: DRAFT THE NOTICE
Clearly mention:
- Creditor and debtor details
- Amount owed
- Due date and nature of debt
- Legal basis of recovery

Step 2: DEMAND PAYMENT
State a firm demand for repayment of the principal and any interest due. Mention that legal action will follow if the amount is not repaid.

Step 3: SEND THE NOTICE
Send via Registered Post with Acknowledgment Due (RPAD) or through an advocate. Keep copies for evidence.

Step 4: WAITING PERIOD
Allow a reasonable time (typically 7–15 days) for repayment before filing a civil recovery suit in court.
