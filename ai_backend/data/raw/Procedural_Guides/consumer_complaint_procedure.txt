GUIDE TO FILING A CONSUMER COMPLAINT (CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019)

A consumer can file a complaint if they suffer loss or damage from defective goods, unfair trade practices, or deficient services.

Step 1: CHECK JURISDICTION
File in the correct Consumer Commission based on claim value:
- District Commission: Up to ₹50 lakh
- State Commission: Above ₹50 lakh and up to ₹2 crore
- National Commission: Above ₹2 crore

Step 2: PREPARE THE COMPLAINT
Write the complaint clearly, describing the issue, date of purchase, and nature of defect or deficiency. Include all supporting documents (bills, warranty cards, photos, emails, etc.).

Step 3: SUBMIT THE COMPLAINT
Submit the complaint physically or electronically within 2 years from the date of cause of action.

Step 4: HEARING AND RELIEF
The Commission may call for hearing both parties and, if satisfied, order refund, replacement, compensation, or discontinuation of unfair practices.
